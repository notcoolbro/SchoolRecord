simple example project for java practice  
based on tasks given in class  
I took some liberties expanding the original task, e.g.:
- created class InputReader to handle user input more cleanly
- teachers can have multiple subjects
- some minor improvements to make console output more readable
- some concepts (especially overloading of functions) are implemented only selectively as proof of concept 

still a practice project and very much work in progress (even the main branch)
